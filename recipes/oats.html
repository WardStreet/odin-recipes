    <p>These oats are one of our best high protein breakfast recipes and will definitively<br>
    give you a protein boost in the morning. Overnight oats simply are raw rolled oats<br>
    that are soaked "overnight" in a liquid-y mixture to then become soft and appetizing. <br>
    They take seconds to prepare and you can flavor them the way you want: there must be <br>
    hundreds of way you can enjoy them! This version gives you a super creamy oat mixture <br>
    that's extra rich in flavor and filled with protein + fiber to keep your gut happy <br>
    and belly full for a while. Plus, the chia and hemps seeds provide some bonus <br>
    omega-3 healthy fats.</p>
